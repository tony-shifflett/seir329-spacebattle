## The ship class for creating the ships in the game
class Ship

    ## Set Getters and Setters
    attr_accessor :hull, :firepower, :accuracy

    ## Constructor, should create hull, firepower and accuracy properties
    def initialize(hull, firepower, accuracy)
    end
end

## generateHull should generate a number between 3 & 6
## readup on standard python random library that is imported into this file
## https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html
def generateHull()
    # two dot ellipsis is inclusive
    return (rand(3.0..6.0))
end

## generateFirepower should generate a number between 2 & 4
def generateFirepower()
    return (rand(2.0..4.0))
end

## generateAccuracy should generate a number between .6 & .8
def generateAccuracy()
    return (rand 0.6..0.8)
end

## Should return a list of 6 Enemy ships with random stands
def enemy_fleet()
    enemy_fleet = []
    for count in 1..6 do 
        enemy_fleet.push(Ship.new(generateHull, generateFirepower, generateAccuracy))
    end
    p enemy_fleet
end

## accuracy_check should
# - be passed an attacking ships accuracy
# - generate a random number between 0-1
# - If that number is equal or below the ships accuracy return true
# - If that number is above the ships return false
def accuracy_check(acc)
end

## Battle, should take an attacking and defending ship
# - If an accuracy check passes
# - the defending ships hull should be reduced by the attacking ships firepower
# - if misses return false
def battle(attacker, defender)
end

##full_battle should loop and allow two ships to attack each other until one dies.
## if ship wins, return true
## if ship2 wins, return false
def full_battle(ship, ship2)
end
        

## Game Setup
$enemies = enemy_fleet
$you = Ship.new(20, 5, 0.7)

## Game Loop Function
def game_loop()
    puts("Welcome to Space Battle, you are on the USS Schwarzenegger and six ships have come to attack")
    # While $enemies still exist in enemy fleet battle the next ship
    while(full_battle($you, $enemies[0]))
        ## remove defeated ship from list
        $enemies.shift
        ## If no $enemies left, you win
        if ($enemies.length <= 0)
            puts("you have defeated the enemy fleet!")
            break
        end
        ## Ask user if they want escape
        puts("type 'escape' if you want to escape or battle next ship") 
        if(gets.chomp.to_i == "escape")
            puts("You have escaped")
        end
        puts("You face the next enemy ship")
    end
